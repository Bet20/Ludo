# Ludo

Ludo is a dumb toy lang that I am doing to learn C++ or something along those lines.
Mainly this repo is a progress tracker/ source manager.
Don't intend to do anything proper with it.
Bad code, mean, bad code is to be expected. *I'm learning after all.*
Wish me luck :=)

Syntax:
```
# Variable declaration
a: num = 1
b: string = "Hello World"

print num.to_str

sum: num a b {
    ret a + b
}

if a eq b { ... } elif a not eq b { ... }
```
